# pekommunity

This repository houses [Peko](https://github.com/sebringrose/peko) middleware, handlers and utilities made by the community. Particularly those useful for integrating external tools, services and cloud providers. 

Storing them in one place helps prevent common logic being replicated across projects and provides a nice productivity boost.

Happy coding ‚úåÔ∏èü§ì

**Note:** All imports used are specified in the `import_map.json` file. 

If you have your own import map (recommended) you will need to copy the imports used by modules you choose into your own map. Otherwise you can copy a module's source code and swap the import name for the import URL associated to it.
