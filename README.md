# pekommunity

The purpose of this repository to house useful (and generic) middleware, handlers and utils from the community, particularly for integrating external tools and services with [Peko](https://github.com/sebringrose/peko) apps. 

Storing them in one place helps prevent common logic being replicated across community projects and provides a nice productivity boost.
